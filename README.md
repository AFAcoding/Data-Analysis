Is German really necessary for working in IT in Germany? 



For some time now, I’ve been improving my German, and while planning my six-month stay in Germany, one key question arose: How essential is German in the IT job market? 



Germany is a major tech hub, home to startups, global corporations, and a thriving IT ecosystem. But is language a real barrier, or is English enough to integrate into the job market?

🔍 Key insights:



Salaries vary significantly by region – Some German states offer considerably better economic opportunities than others.



Language still plays an important role – While English is widely spoken in international environments, German remains relevant, especially in smaller companies and less populated cities.

IT salaries differ based on role, company type, and location, making it crucial to consider these factors when looking for opportunities in Germany.
